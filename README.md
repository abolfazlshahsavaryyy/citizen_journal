# Citizen Journal API

A modern, full-featured **Django + FastAPI** web API platform that empowers citizens to share, discuss, and verify news in a decentralized and transparent way.

---

## Overview

This project consists of two integrated backend services:

### 1. **Citizen Journal Backend (Django + PostgreSQL)**

A RESTful API for users (citizens) to create content, interact, and manage discussions. Key features include:

- **User Registration & Authentication** using JWT (access + refresh tokens)
- **Page System**: Each user owns a *Page* that acts as their personal hub
- **News Publishing**: Users can create *News* posts on their pages
- **Commenting & Replies**: News posts support comments with recursive replies
- **Discussions**: Each page has its own *Discussion* area with:
  - Multiple *Topics* (added by the page owner)
  - Each *Topic* supports *Questions* from other users
  - Each *Question* can be answered by others â€” enabling rich, threaded discussion

### 2. **Fake News Detection Service (FastAPI + ML)**

An intelligent microservice built with **FastAPI** that detects the authenticity of published news.

- Trained with **Logistic Regression**
- Achieved **99.25% accuracy** on test data
- Exposes an API endpoint used by the Django service to evaluate news reliability

## Authentication

- **JWT Token Auth**:
  - `/api/token/`: Login with username & password to receive access/refresh tokens
  - `/api/token/refresh/`: Refresh access token using refresh token
- **Registration**:
  - `/api/register/`: Register a new user along with their profile and avatar

- **Comments**: News posts support threaded comments and replies
- **Discussions**:
  - Topics (created by page owners)
  - Questions (asked by anyone)
  - Answers (provided by the community)
- **Fake News Detection**: Real-time validity scoring of news via FastAPI service
